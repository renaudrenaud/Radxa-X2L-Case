# Radxa-X2L-Case
Radxa X2L 3D printed Cases

![image](images/radxa_red.png)

The Radxa X2L is a cool little board, but it's a SBC and doesn't come with a case right now (december 2023).

This project is here to propose some 3D printed cases for the Radxa X2L.

The case is designed to be printed in two parts, the top and bottom, except the v0 wich is a single part for the bottom, a way to quick print something to protect the board.

Designers are welcome to propose their own design, and I will add them to the project.

I am not the designer of the cases, I just manage this repo.

Enjoy !
